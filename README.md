# PyBank  

*A simple banking system powered by Flask (Python).*

## 💡 Overview  

PyBank is a lightweight web application that simulates basic banking functionality.  
It’s built with Flask and provides a minimal front-end (HTML/CSS) to interact with user accounts — a simple demo/prototype rather than a production-ready banking system.

## 🧱 Features  

- Basic account interface (via Flask + HTML templates + CSS + static assets)  
- Web-based front-end and routing through `app.py`  
- Example pages (e.g. account view, possibly deposit/withdraw, or other banking operations — depending on your implementation)
